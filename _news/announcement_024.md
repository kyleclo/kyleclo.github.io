[OLMoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02060) accepted as an **Oral** (top 1.8% of 11.6K submissions) at **ICLR 2025**! Congrats Niklas. I'm also going to be giving a talk on data curation for OLMo 2 at the [Data Problems for Foundation Models workshop](https://datafm.github.io/). See you all in Singapore 🇸🇬!
