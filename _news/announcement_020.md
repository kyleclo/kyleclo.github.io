Giving a **tutorial** on [Opening the Language Model Pipeline](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/tutorial/99526) at **NeurIPS 2024** with my colleagues Akshita Bhagia and Nathan Lambert! We'll cover data preparation, model training, and adaptation methods using open software and data. Excited to share tips, tricks, and otherwise inaccessible details from building OLMo!
