Interested in working with me? Apply to join our team as a [**Research Intern**](#research-internship) or [**Predoctoral Researcher**](#predoctoral-research)!


As an intern or predoctoral researcher, you'll work directly with me and other full-time researchers on a research project tailored to your interests. We aim for high-impact research publications at top-tier computer science venues, and we make all project artifacts open and accessible, including code, models and data.

See [**FAQs**](#faqs) for more info about working with me.

### FAQs

⚠️ **For 2025/2026 applicants** ⚠️ I'm specifically looking for candidates who are available for extended internships (20+ weeks) and excited to contribute to the [OLMo project](https://allenai.org/olmo). 

For interns:

* **Who?** 
  * **Eligibility?** 
    * ✅ Current students,
    * ✅ Incoming students to a PhD program,
    * ❌ Non-students,
    * ✅ Domestic and international applicants welcome.
  * **Experience?** 
    * Most interns are PhD students, but we've also (on rare occasion) hired exceptional Master's and undergraduate students,
    * I tend to hire students with aligned interests as me and a track record of research contributions, whether that's writing papers (published or preprints) or open-source contributions. Your total publication count or university affiliation doesn't matter; I look more for a good collaboration fit and quality of work. Engineering skills are a must and just as important as research skills.
* **When?** All research internships are paid, full-time positions for 12 weeks, though we have also done extended internships on part-time basis. Start times are flexible, though I typically recommend starting in May or June for summer internships as there is usually a large, fun cohort at the office. 
* **Where?** Internships are typically in-person at the AI2 office in Seattle. I've also hired remote interns before, but only on rare exception.
* **How?** Apply at the link above and mention my name in your application. I recommend taking a look at my recent publications to get a sense of what type of projects I'm interested in.

For predocs:

* **Who?** 
  * **Eligibility?** This is a great position for:
    * ✅ Any prospective PhD applicant, including current students near graduation and former students already working,
    * ✅ Anyone already been accepted to a PhD program and looking to defer enrollment for a year,
    * ❌ Already enrolled in a PhD program,
    * ✅ Domestic and international applicants welcome.
  * **Experience?**
    * Some research experience required. You don't need many papers, nor do they have to be published (preprints are OK).
    * Strong coding skills preferred. Especially if you can point to contributions to open-source projects or demonstrations of your work. You don't need industry software development experience.
* **When?** All predoctoral research positions are paid, full-time positions for 1-3 years. Start times are flexible. Contracts must be renewed each year. 
* **Where?** All predoctoral research positions must be in-person at the AI2 office in Seattle at least part of the week.
* **How?** Apply at the link above and mention my name in your application. I recommend taking a look at my recent publications to get a sense of what type of projects I'm interested in.

Advice for all applicants:
  * We read all your appication short answer responses. Since we get a lot of applicants, I encourage you to be thoughtful & creative. Avoid sounding too generic.
