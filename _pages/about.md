I'm a research scientist at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/) where I co-lead the [OLMo](https://allenai.org/olmo) project on open language modeling.

<!-- for scientific research assistance  -->
My current research focuses on large-scale pretraining of language models, with an emphasis on data curation and efficient experimentation. I’m also interested in methods for specializing language models to domains. I'm interested in AI for science and education, and graviate towards human-AI interaction problems like sensemaking over large collections or augmented reading interfaces. Finally, I also like building useful artifacts that support research, like open corpora and OCR tools.

 <!-- we make them more accessible by automatically transforming papers into dynamic web documents with helpful interactive features?  -->


<!-- I've also worked as a statistician / data scientist in Seattle and an applied probability researcher at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en) in Taiwan.  I graduated in 2015 with an MS in [Statistics from the University of Washington](https://www.stat.washington.edu/). -->

The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. Link to your social media connections, too.
